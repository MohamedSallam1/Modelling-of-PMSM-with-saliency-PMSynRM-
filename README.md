# Modelling-of-PMSM-with-saliency-PMSynRM-
The model represents a synchronous motor with permanent magnet , saliency and  damper winding to compensate for iron core losses 
the pdf file represent the mathematical equations 
while the slx file is the simulink model

motor parameters can be edited from model propertied >call backs > initfcn*
